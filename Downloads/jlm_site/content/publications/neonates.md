title: "A time series analysis of the ecologic relationship between acute and intermediate PM2.5 exposure duration on neonatal intensive care unit admissions in Florida"
date: 2021-05-01
pubtype: "Paper"
featured: true
description: "We paired over one million birth records in the state of Florida with daily air pollution estimations and other demographic data to explore the influence of air pollution on neonatal intensive care unit admissions from 2012 to 2019 at the zip code level. Elevated air pollution was associated with an increase in admissions when accounting for confounding factors. As co-author my role involved acquiring and processing environmental data and estimating air pollution using a variety of methods."
