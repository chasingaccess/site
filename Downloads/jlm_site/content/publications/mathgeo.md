description: "This mechanistic model was made for a competition held by the CDC’s Epidemic Prediction Initiative to forecast the probability of detecting two species of disease transmitting mosquito in a number of counties a month in advance. Our model combined data from laboratory studies on the effects of temperature on life traits as well as weather forecasts to predict presence. Our predictions were then validated against actual catch data from mosquito control agencies in participating counties. "
