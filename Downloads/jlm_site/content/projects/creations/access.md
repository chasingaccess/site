Health accessibility models have been used to identify regions that are medically under-served due to their population and distance from medical facilities. I used these models to identify neighborhoods in the city of Huaquillas that may lack access to vector control services. I also simulate how different placements of workers and resources could improve access and identify locations to optimally place a new facility.
